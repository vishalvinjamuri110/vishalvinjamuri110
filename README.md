👋 Hey there! I’m Vishal – a CS undergrad | Explorer at heart | Visual storyteller
💻 Computer Science Enthusiast
Final-year B.Tech CSE student passionate about AI, Data Science, and Full-Stack Development. I enjoy architecting smart solutions, building clean backend systems, and deploying ML models. Currently exploring ML pipelines, AWS (S3, Lambda, RDS), and data engineering workflows.

📸 Visual Storyteller
Beyond code, I create cinematic content that captures nature, cities, and untold moments. I run travel_pedia123, a travel page where visuals meet storytelling. My camera is my second keyboard.

🌍 Lifelong Learner & Explorer
Travel fuels my curiosity, photography channels my creativity, and code anchors my ambition. I believe the best ideas come when we blend disciplines and explore new perspectives — technically and culturally.

🤖 ML & NLP Projects (LSTM, Recommenders)

☁️ ETL pipelines using Python + AWS

🧠 LeetCode 75 & system design prep

🎓 Building a portfolio for grad school + internships
